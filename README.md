### ðŸ“ŒREQUIREMENTS :
- python 3
- tkinter module
- filedialog from tkinter
- messagebox
- from PIL import Image, ImageTk
- cv2
- numpy
- os
- random
- moviepy

****

### ðŸ“ŒHOW TO Use it :
- User just need to download the file, and run the video_encryption_decryption.py, on local system.
- After running a GUI window appears, where user can start the video encryption decryption application by clicking on the START button.
- After that a new GUI window will open, in which user will have buttons like SELECT, ENCRYPT VIDEO, DECRYPT VIDEO, RESET and EXIT.
- User can select any video file (either mpy, mkv, avi, or any other extension of video) from the local system, using SELECT button.
- After user has selected video, user will be able to see the path of the video selected in the text area.
- After this, when user clicks on the ENCRYPT VIDEO button, the encryption process will start and user will be shown an encrypted video as a preview.
- After that user can decrypt the encrypted video, using DECRYPT VIDEO which will show decrypted video as a preview.
- Also there is a RESET button, clicking on which user can reset the video to original format, which will show the preview for the same.
- Also there is an EXIT button clicking opn which user can exit from the application.

### ðŸ“ŒPurpose :
- This scripts helps user to easily to encrypt, decrypt or reset to original format by selecting any video from local system.

### ðŸ“ŒCompilation Steps :
- Install tkinter, PIL, cv2, numpy, os, random, moviepy
- After that download the code file, and run video_encryption_decryption.py on local system.
- Then the script will start running and user can explore selecting any video and encrypting and decrypting it and seeing the preview for the same.
